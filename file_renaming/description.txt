I renamed several text file in a folder to JPG file by using this simple python script
#What the script does is that ,it searches for all text file in the that folder 
#Appends them to  a list of text file
#Then it loops through the list of text files changing the file extension of each file , one after the other to .JPG
 NB. this python script can be customized according to the users needs
